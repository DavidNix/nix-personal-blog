This was a presentation I gave at the Denver Go Meetup in November 2015.  

My goal is to teach others and myself how to build a robust, modern web application in Go. My hope is that startups will turn to Go instead of Rails or Django when building web apps.

What is a “modern web app”?  It’s a server that does all this:  

* Routing
* Middleware
* Request Scoped Data
* User Authentication
* Interfaces with a database
* Compiles js, csss, images and other assets
* Renders templates and views
* Serves static files
* Shuts down gracefully
* Sends transactional email
* Live reloading
* Logging

and more.

**Disclaimer:**  This is an exploration. I am not an expert on the subject. I’ve built microservices in Go but have yet to build a monolith similar to Rails or Django.

This is the first in a multi-part series.  How many parts?  I’m not sure yet.

Part 2 (you’re reading it)

I welcome any feedback or criticism.
