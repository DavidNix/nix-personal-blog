This was a presentation I gave at the Denver Go Meetup in September 2015.  

My goal is to teach others and myself how to build a robust, modern web application in Go. My hope is that startups will turn to Go instead of Rails or Django when building web apps.

What is a “modern web app”?  It’s a server that does all this:

* Routing
* Middleware
* Request Scoped Data
* User Authentication
* Interfaces with a database
* Compiles js, csss, images and other assets
* Renders templates and views
* Serves static files
* Shuts down gracefully
* Sends transactional email
* Live reloading
* Logging

and more.  

**Disclaimer:**  This is an exploration. I am not an expert on the subject. I’ve built microservices in Go but have yet to build a monolith similar to Rails or Django.

This is the first in a multi-part series.  How many parts?  I’m not sure yet.

Part 1 (you’re reading it)  

[Part 2](/post/building-modern-web-apps-in-go-part-2)

**Warning:**  I make fun of Rails a LOT.  On purpose.  If you’re BFFs with DHH, consider yourself warned.

I welcome any feedback or criticism.
